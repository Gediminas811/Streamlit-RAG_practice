The castle at the confluence of the Ne­munas and Neris rivers was built in 
the 14th century to defend against the onslaught of crusaders. This is not only 
one of the first stone castles in Lithuania, but also the only one that has two 
rows of defensive walls. A settlement that grew into the current city was cre­
ated around the Gothic defences. Kau­nas castle was first mentioned in writ­
ten sources in 1361. According to legend, Queen Bona Sforza’s troops mysteriously 
disappeared in the tunnels underneath. Although it was restored multiple 
times, the castle lost its importance in 1408 when Kaunas was granted Magde­
burg rights and the life of the whole city moved to the Market (Town Hall) Square.
